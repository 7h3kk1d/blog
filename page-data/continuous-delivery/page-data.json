Working from home due to COVID-19 has presented me with a bit of time to worok on some personal projects (this blog include). So the first thing I did was update the blog to gatsby v2 which was mostly mechanical dependency updates and a few major breaking changes documented <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/migrating-from-v1-to-v2/\">here</a>. </p>\n<p>The next goal in order to speed up development is to get some form of CI/CD set up because I was manually deploying this every time I would tweak something or even add a new post. Since this site is hosted on <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\">GitHub Pages</a> I decided it would probably be best to implement CD using <a href=\"https://github.com/features/actions\">GitHub Actions</a>. Luckily there is already an action created to autopublish Gatsby sites to GitHub Pages <a href=\"https://github.com/marketplace/actions/gatsby-publish\">here</a>. So hopefully now that the dev workflow is quicker I will be able to update more often.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Continuous Delivery","date":"29 March, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/continuous-delivery/"}}}
